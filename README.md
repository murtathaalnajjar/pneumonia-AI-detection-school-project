This Python script demonstrates the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to make predictions on the Iris dataset. The code uses machine learning to train an SVM model on the Iris dataset and then test its performance on a validation set. It carries out the following tasks:
It imports the libraries required for data processing and machine learning functions. The Iris dataset is fetched from a specific URL and given column names. The dataset is separated into training and validation sets. An SVM model is constructed via automatic gamma value selection. The model is trained using the training data. The trained model is applied to the validation dataset to make predictions. Metrics like accuracy score are used to evaluate the performance of the forecasts.
